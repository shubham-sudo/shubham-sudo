- 👋 Hi, I’m @shubham-sudo a Software Engineer based at Boston.
- 👀 I’m interested in designing large scale data-intensive systems with backend development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning deep level concepts (BufferPool, Pages, Tuples etc.) of sql databases, design patterns & standards of OOP's paradigm and few advance algorithms (Network-flow) while pursuing my Master's in Computer Science.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data-centric projects where I could get a chance to build/maintain systems, which handles heavy data.
